-- Sorting queries with various attributes including substrings and order by.

-- Example 1 --
SELECT
*
FROM
movie_dataset.movie_table
WHERE
substr(movie_title, 1, 3) = 'The'
and genre = 'Action'
-- lines 8-10, filtering for movies that start with The, but also within genre Action
ORDER BY
release_date, budget_ desc

-- Example 2 --
SELECT
*
FROM
movie_dataset.movie_table
WHERE
GENRE = "Comedy"
AND Cast__1_ = "Jim Carrey"
or Genre = "Comedy" and Cast__2_ = "Emily Blunt"
Order By
release_date
-- Notes for example 2: if using AND and OR the filter doesn't carry past the OR. So, start with AND then add an OR then
-- use AND again for the results to carry forward to the second piece, lines 22 and 23.
