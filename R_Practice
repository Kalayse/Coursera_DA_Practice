**Learning R with Coursera DA Course. All work is my own, based on what I have learned from the course**

R Console, desktop
Notes: Available demo packages in RGui per demo(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))
1. 'grDevices': colors, hclColors
2. 'lattice': intervals, labels, lattice, panel
3. 'stats': glm.vr, lm.glm, nlm, smooth 
4. 'tcltk': tkcanvas, tkdensity, tkfaq, tkttest

RStudio:
If you want more information about a function - ?function() > execute, will yield information on it.

Basics:
- Function(argument)
- To assign a variable, stick with one syntax type for consistency. 
    The one used in course is as follows: first_variable <- "What the value of the first variable represents". 
    Note: The output will appear in the Environments pane with the Value being first_variable and print of "What the value of the first variable represents". 
    To do: Try this in other methods with fucntions to see how the output table looks.
