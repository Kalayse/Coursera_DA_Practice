**Learning R with Coursera DA Course. All work is my own, based on what I have learned from the course**

R Console, desktop
Notes: Available demo packages in RGui per demo(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))
1. 'grDevices': colors, hclColors
2. 'lattice': intervals, labels, lattice, panel
3. 'stats': glm.vr, lm.glm, nlm, smooth 
4. 'tcltk': tkcanvas, tkdensity, tkfaq, tkttest

RStudio:
If you want more information about a function - ?function() > execute, will yield information on it.

Basics:
- Function(argument)
- To assign a variable, stick with one syntax type for consistency. 
    The one used in course is as follows: first_variable <- "What the value of the first variable represents". 
    Note: The output will appear in the Environments pane with the Value being first_variable and print of "What the value of the first variable represents". 
    To do: Try this in other methods with fucntions to see how the output table looks.
    
Uploading Datasets:
- To use a dataset that you have downloaded on your PC. You will first have to add it as part of the project within RStudio. 
Utilize the bottom right pane Files > Upload > Select location where you want the dataset to be housed.
- Once the dataset is uploaded within RStudio it becomes available to be used as part of your R-Session. This means that you will have
run code in order to make it available as part of your R-Session.
- Example of code needed for an xls or xlsx file type:
    library(readxl) ##to use tidyverse readxl package
    Dataset_Name_in_R <- read_excel("Path within RStudio/to access/Uploaded Dataset.xlsx")
    View(Dataset_Name_in_R)
    
Data Frame Editing, Basics:
To create new variables in the dataframe:
    mutate( ) function, only to the new dataframe and not the imported one.
    mutate(new_dataframe_name, [what’s being mutated])
To rename columns:
    rename(data_frame, “New_Name” = Old_Name)
        Rename multiple with a comma after the first one.
        R will output a tibble in the console.
        Assign it a new variable to keep it for reference.
Use colnames(data_frame) to figure out the names of the columns you want to rename.
